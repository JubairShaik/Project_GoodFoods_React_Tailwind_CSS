Why 2 Libraies - ?



npm i @reduxjs/toolkit and  (npm i react-redux)
What iS the Job Of Redux ?
=> redux Main Job Is To Manage The Store and Maintains It...

RTK = Redux toolkit 
configureStore will come from  @reduxjs/toolkit

import {configureStore} @reduxjs/toolkit

we Will Need a <Provider/> (Like A Supplier:)

 We Can Provide Store to either Entire app OR Some Particular Components

 import {Provider} from "react-redux"


createSlice=>


import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name:"cart",
    initialState:{
        items:[],
    }
})


initialState === state


we Will Modify The Cart Using Reducer Function 

Reducers Will be Called On Dispach Of An Action 

#Reducer is Also a Function

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name:"cart",
    initialState:{
        items:[],
    },
    reducers:{
        addItem:()=>{
            
        }
    }
})

cartSlice Will Need a name...
Then An initialState..then Some Reducers
reducers Will Contain Some Mapping Of Actions and a reducer function 

...
How We Will Modify The Store is ..
the Reducer Function takes in two Things (state,action)
---------------------------------------
const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name:"cart",
    initialState:{
        items:[],
    },
    reducers:{
        addItem: (state,action) => {

        }
    }
})
{/*-------------------------------------------*/}

intitial State IS Empty 
and (Action) is the New Data Coming In ... (from UI)

  addItem: (state, action) => {
  |     state.items.push(action.payload);
  |
  }

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name:"cart",
    initialState:{
        items:["Apples","Bananana"],
    },
    reducers:{
        
        addItem : (state, action) => {
            state.items.push(action.payload);
        },
        removeItem:(state,action) =>{
            state.items.pop();
             
        },
        clearCart : (state,action) => {
            state.items = []
        },
    },
});

export default cartSlice.reducer ;


{-------------------Behind The Scenes------------------}

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name:"cart",
    initialState:{
        items:["Apples","Bananana"],
    },
    reducers:{  
        addItem : (state, action) => {
            state.items.push(action.payload);
        },
        removeItem:(state,action) =>{
            state.items.pop();
             
        },
        clearCart : (state,action) => {
            state.items = []
        },
    },
});

export const { addItem , removeItem , clearCart } = cartSlice.actions ;
export default cartSlice.reducer ;

{**********
cartSlice ={
    actions:{
        addItem,
        removeItem,
    }
    reducer:reducers
}
***********}



import {configureStore} from "@reduxjs/toolkit" ;
import cartSlice from "./cartSlice";

const store = configureStore({

    reducer:{
        cart:cartSlice,
    }

});

export default store


The Name Of the Object Will Be "reducer" #OnlyOne 
  reducer:{
        cart:cartSlice,
    }
    
    #onerootreducer
    :)





import { userSelector } from "react-redux";

the Job of userSelector is to gives you Access to Store
